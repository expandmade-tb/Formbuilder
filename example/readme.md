To start the demo, double click the **startDemo** script or open a terminal and enter **./startDemo**. The script will start the php buildin server on port 8080 and then start firefox / chromium. Other browsers you will have to change the script.

The actual Formbuilder demo script which you might be interested in, can be found in **/app/controller/FormDemo.php**. The rest is just to make it work in a browser without huge framework.
